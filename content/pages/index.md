    title: Hello! Iâ€™m Tara Lynn.
    text: >
      My love for human form, experience, and story has guided me from the dance
      floor, to the yoga mat, and finally to become a doctor of physical
      therapy.


      A dancer by training and a yogi by chance, I am fascinated by the ways in
      which we hold stories in our bodies. Delving into the world of chronic
      pain, I am on the path to uncovering how our beliefs, our community, and
      our environment shape how we experience pain.


      I am an experiential believer that we can explore our pain to uncover the
      stories that guide us, and even ENJOY the process while we are at it!
